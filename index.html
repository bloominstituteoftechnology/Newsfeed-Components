        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p class="date">Aug 18th, 2008</p>

        <p>Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as
          trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
          most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
          Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
          avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
          minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,
          and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must
          be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
          A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties
          can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
          over a communications channel without a trusted party. </p>

        <p>What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,
          allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted
          third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers
          from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In
          this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed
          timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The
          system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any
          cooperating group of attacker nodes.</p>

        <h2>2. Transactions</h2>
        <p class="date">Aug 18th, 2008</p>
        <p>We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the coin to the
          next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner
          and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of
          ownership.</p>
          
        <p>The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend
            the coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every
            transaction for double spending. After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to
            issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent.
            The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the
            company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.</p>
      
        <p>We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier
          transactions. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care
          about later attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to
          be aware of all transactions. In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and
          decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be
          publicly announced [1], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the
          order in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the
          majority of nodes agreed it was the first received. </p>

        <h2>3. Timestamp Server</h2>
        <p class="date">Aug 18th, 2008</p>

        <p>The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server. A timestamp server works by taking a
          hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a
          newspaper or Usenet post [2-5]. The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the
          time, obviously, in order to get into the hash. Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in
          its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.</p>

        <h2>4. Proof-of-Work</h2>
        <p class="date">Aug 18th, 2008</p>
        <p>To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proofof-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts.
          The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the
          hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number
          of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash. </p>
        
        <p>For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the
          block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits. Once the CPU
          effort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed
          without redoing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block
          would include redoing all the blocks after it.</p>
        
        <p>The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision
          making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone
          able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority
          decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
          in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the
          fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to
          redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the
          work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up
          diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.
          </p>

        <p>To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time,
          the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of
          blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases. </p>

        <h2>5. Network</h2>
        <p class="date">Aug 18th, 2008</p>

        <p>The steps to run the network are as follows:
          <ol>
            <li>New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.</li>
            <li>Each node collects new transactions into a block.</li>
            <li>Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.</li>
            <li>When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.</li>
            <li>Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.</li>
            <li>Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.</li>
          </ol>
          
          Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on
          extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some
          nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received,
          but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proofof-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other
          branch will then switch to the longer one. </p>

        <p>New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes. As long as they reach
            many nodes, they will get into a block before long. Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped
            messages. If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and
            realizes it missed one.</p>

          <h2>6. Incentive</h2>
          <p class="date">Aug 18th, 2008</p>
  
          <p>By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned
              by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides
              a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.
              The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending
              resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.</p>
  
          <p>The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is
              less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of
              the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered
              circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
              free.</p>
          
          <p>The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to
              assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
              to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to
              find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
              everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.</p>

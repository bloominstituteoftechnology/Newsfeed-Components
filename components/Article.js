// This is the data we will be using to create our articles. Look at it, then proceed to line 93.
// OPTIONAL: if you're feeling adventurous, try to make this data an export from a different module, and import it here.

function articleMaker({title, date, firstParagraph, secondParagraph, thirdParagraph}){
  const article = document.createElement('div');
  
}
/*
  Step 1: Write a component called 'articleMaker' to create an article.
  Your component is a function that takes an article object as its only argument,
  and returns a DOM node looking like the one below:

  <div class="article">
    <h2>{title of the article}</h2>
    <p class="date">{date of the article}</p>

    {three separate paragraph elements}

    <span class="expandButton">+</span>
  </div>

  Step 2: Still inside `articleMaker`, add an event listener to the span.expandButton.
  This listener should toggle the class 'article-open' on div.article.

  Step 3: Don't forget to return something from your function!

  Step 4: Outside your function now, loop over the data. At each iteration you'll use your component
  to create a div.article element and append it to the DOM inside div.articles (see index.html).

  Step 5: Try adding new article object to the data array. Make sure it is in the same format as the others.
  Refresh the page to see the new article.
